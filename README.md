🚗 Car Rental System (Core Java Project)
📘 Overview

The Car Rental System is a console-based Java application designed to manage a simple car rental service.
It allows customers to view available cars, rent and return cars, and automatically calculates rental costs based on the car type and duration.

This project demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, along with the use of Java Collections, Exception Handling, and Java 8 Streams.
